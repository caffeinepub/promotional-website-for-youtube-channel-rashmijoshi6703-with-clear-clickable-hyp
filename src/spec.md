## Summary
**Goal:** Create a responsive, single-page promotional website for YouTube channel @rashmijoshi6703 with a polished visual theme and prominent, accessible clickable hyperlinks to the channel.

**Planned changes:**
- Build a responsive single-page layout with sections: Hero (headline/subheadline + primary Subscribe CTA), About, Featured content (grid of link cards), and Contact/Links.
- Add a site header with in-page anchor navigation and an easily accessible (sticky or prominent) Subscribe CTA linking to https://www.youtube.com/@rashmijoshi6703.
- Ensure all external links are clearly styled, keyboard-focusable, include hover/focus states, and open in a new tab with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
- Apply a coherent creative theme (not primarily blue/purple) with consistent typography, spacing, buttons, cards, and backgrounds.
- Add basic SEO/shareability: meaningful document title, English meta description, and English hero headline/subheadline.
- Include and render static generated image assets from `frontend/public/assets/generated` (hero/banner + avatar placeholder + social/icons set) with appropriate English alt text.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can view a polished, mobile-friendly promo page for @rashmijoshi6703, navigate sections, and click prominent Subscribe and featured links that open safely in new tabs.
